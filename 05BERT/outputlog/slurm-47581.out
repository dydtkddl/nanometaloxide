Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /data/dydtkddhkdwk/matplotlib-9b1wb8yw because the default path (/home/dydtkddhkdwk/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at ./repos/OXIDE/scibert_scivocab_cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
